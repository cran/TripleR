# ---- Changes in TripleR version 0.4.2  ----------------------
#------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

- Added a NEWS file (you're reading it) to document changes
- Relationship effects now have a new column called 'dyad'. This facilitates subsequent dyadic analyses.
- Relationship effects now are sorted that each pair of dyadic effects is in consecutive lines
- Added new labeling system: all labels can now centrally controlled by one function: RR.style. 
You set your styles once at the beginning of the project (e.g., RR.style("perception")), and all 
subsequent calls of RR are styled accordingly (i.e., in RR.print appropriate labels are taken, and 
the suffixes of the effects are appropriately set)
- Reliability of relationship effects now is printed (provided only in latent analyses)


MINOR IMPROVEMENTS/ CHANGES

- Improved help files
- Removed warning, that variance components < 10% should not be interpreted (the relevant indicator is 
the significance of these components)
- The labels of the reliabilities now are correctly set to actor/partner or perceiver/target, 
depending on the style set.
- Fixed line breaks in the vignette


BUG FIXES

- Labeling of perception/metaperception now is correct
